title: My Goal with the How To Find Plants Site
---

I'm a person with more hobbies than I know what to do with. One of the hobbies that I'm most passionate about is foraging.

There are many aspects to being a successful forager, but one of the most difficult aspects is actually finding the plants in the wild. Sure, there are many things to consider once you actually find that plant and decide to harvest it, but it is legitimately tricky to figure out the when, where, and how you should go about finding that plant.

So my work on this site is about how I tackle that very specific problem. I'm a software developer in my (somewhat limited) spare time, so I spend a lot of time exploring different datasets that are publicly avaialable. I'm located in the state of Wisconsin in the United States, so the datasets I employ might only be useful to others in the US. I use these data sources because I believe this approach is the most reproducible strategy I can come up with.

Most of the posts on this site will cover strategies for a specific plant. However, some posts will talk about the different software projects I'm working on that are relevant to this problem. These projects might be mobile apps or browser extensions, but they will be available to the public. So keep an eye on this space if you're interested in hearing more about that.

That's all for now. Happy foraging!
