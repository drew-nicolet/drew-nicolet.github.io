Building the below projects is my way to combine my passions for buiding software and spending time in the outdoors. I try to focus on projects that are tools for the outdoorsy person, and I avoid building things that would distract you from actually enjoying nature.

Below are the projects I'm working on:

## Habitat Aware

Habitat Aware is a mobile app that serve's as Nature's Search Engine. Tell the app what you're looking for, where you're located, and it will let you know which plants are relevant and why they matter. It's currently only on Android, but iOS is coming soon. The data only covers the US and Canada, so it's only available in those countries.

It's 100% free to use, doesn't need email sign-up, and is ad-free. Best of all: it's built to work offline, so you can actually use it in the woods.

## Seasonally

Seasonally is a browser extension that helps you live a more seasonal lifestyle. It's not yet available, but should be in the Chrome Extensions store sometime before the spring of 2023.

## More Will Be Coming

I have more project ideas than I know what to do with, so I'll surely be adding to this page in the future.
