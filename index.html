<h1>Welcome to How to Find Plants!</h1>
<p>This site is about solving this problem: <em>how do you most effectively find plants in the wild?</em> If that sounds interesting to you, you've come to the right spot.</p>
<p>My name is Drew Meulemans and I share my experience with this problem here. I'm a stay-at-home dad, software developer, and passionate forager. <a href="/my-projects">My approach</a> to tackling this problem tries to make the most out of modern datasets, and I like to build <a href="/my-projects">software projects</a> that help foragers.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a list of my most recent posts.</p>
